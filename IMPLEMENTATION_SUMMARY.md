# Implementation Summary - Three Key Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the three key changes requested:

1. **Knowledge Base Management Tab** - Frontend interface for document management
2. **Fine Tune Agents Tab** - Frontend interface for system prompt customization
3. **CSV Ingestion Fix** - Ensured all CSV rows are ingested, not just first 10

## 1. Knowledge Base Management Tab

### Features Implemented
- **Document Listing**: View all documents in each agent's knowledge base
- **Document Upload**: Upload new documents and assign them to specific agents
- **Document Deletion**: Remove documents from specific agent knowledge bases
- **Agent Selection**: Choose which agent to manage documents for
- **File Type Support**: PDF, CSV, TXT, DOCX files

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (app.py)
- Added new tab "üìö Knowledge Base Management" to the main interface
- Created `_create_knowledge_base_management_tab()` method
- Implemented document listing with DataFrame display
- Added file upload functionality with agent assignment
- Added document deletion with confirmation

#### Backend (database/vector_db.py)
- Added `list_documents()` method to retrieve all documents from an agent's index
- Enhanced document management capabilities
- Proper namespace handling for each agent

#### Data Processing (utils/data_processor.py)
- Added `_extract_content_from_file()` method for handling uploaded files
- Supports multiple file types (PDF, CSV, TXT, DOCX)
- Proper metadata extraction for uploaded documents

### Usage
1. Select an agent from the dropdown
2. View current documents in a table format
3. Upload new documents by selecting files and clicking "Upload to Knowledge Base"
4. Delete documents by selecting from dropdown and clicking "Delete Document"

## 2. Fine Tune Agents Tab

### Features Implemented
- **System Prompt Viewing**: Display current system prompts for each agent
- **System Prompt Editing**: Modify system prompts through a text editor
- **Prompt Saving**: Save changes to configuration file
- **Default Reset**: Reset prompts to their original values
- **Agent Selection**: Choose which agent to fine-tune

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (app.py)
- Added new tab "‚öôÔ∏è Fine Tune Agents" to the main interface
- Created `_create_fine_tune_agents_tab()` method
- Implemented text area for viewing and editing prompts
- Added save and reset functionality

#### Configuration Management
- Created `agent_prompts.json` file to store system prompts
- Implemented JSON-based prompt management
- Added methods for loading, updating, and resetting prompts

#### Methods Added
- `_get_agent_system_prompt()`: Load current prompt from JSON
- `_update_agent_system_prompt()`: Save updated prompt to JSON
- `_get_default_system_prompt()`: Reset to original prompt

### Usage
1. Select an agent from the dropdown
2. View current system prompt in read-only text area
3. Edit the prompt in the editable text area
4. Click "Save Changes" to update the prompt
5. Click "Reset to Default" to restore original prompt

## 3. CSV Ingestion Fix

### Issue Identified
The original CSV processing was only extracting the first 10 rows using `df.head(10)`, which meant large CSV files were not being fully ingested.

### Fix Implemented
- **Modified `_extract_csv_content()` method** in `utils/data_processor.py`
- **Changed from `df.head(10)` to `df.to_string(index=False)`**
- **Now ingests ALL rows** from CSV files, not just the first 10

### Verification
Created `test_csv_ingestion.py` to verify the fix:
- Tests the main quality systems CSV file (11 rows)
- Tests the SNC database CSV file (313 rows)
- Tests the SOP tracker CSV file (30 rows)
- All files now show complete ingestion of all rows

### Test Results
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: All 11 rows were ingested correctly!
‚úÖ SUCCESS: All 313 rows were ingested correctly!
‚úÖ SUCCESS: All 30 rows were ingested correctly!
```

- `_extract_content_from_file()` - New method for processing uploaded files

## Benefits

### Knowledge Base Management
- **Centralized Control**: Manage all documents from one interface
- **Agent-Specific Organization**: Each document is associated with one agent
- **Easy Maintenance**: Upload and delete documents without technical knowledge
- **Better Organization**: Clear view of what documents each agent has access to

### Fine Tune Agents
- **Customization**: Tailor agent behavior without code changes
- **Flexibility**: Adjust prompts based on specific use cases
- **Version Control**: Easy to revert changes with reset functionality
- **User-Friendly**: No technical knowledge required for prompt updates

### CSV Ingestion Fix
