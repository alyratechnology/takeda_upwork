# Enhanced Agent Routing and Document Citation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive enhancements made to the Smart Audit Orchestrator Agent system to implement advanced agent routing, cross-agent communication, and detailed document citation capabilities.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Advanced Agent Routing System

#### Enhanced Intent Recognition
- **Weighted Pattern Matching**: Implemented sophisticated intent detection using weighted keyword patterns
- **Multiple Intent Types**: Added support for 13 different intent types including:
  - `audit_checklist`, `audit_agenda`, `audit_report`
  - `delta_analysis`, `health_assessment`, `trend_analysis`
  - `quality_analysis`, `sop_review`, `regulatory_research`
  - `conference_analysis`, `supplier_audit`, `internal_audit`, `regulatory_audit`

#### Intelligent Agent Selection
- **Capability-Based Routing**: Agents are selected based on their primary and secondary capabilities
- **Scoring System**: Each agent receives a relevance score based on:
  - Intent alignment (primary: 3.0 points, secondary: 1.5 points)
  - Keyword matching (1.0 point per match)
  - Company-specific relevance (1.0 point for known companies)
- **Threshold-Based Selection**: Only agents with scores above 1.0 are included

#### Agent Capability Mapping
```python
agent_capabilities = {
    'internal_audit': {
        'primary_intents': ['audit_checklist', 'audit_agenda', 'audit_report', 'internal_audit'],
        'secondary_intents': ['health_assessment', 'trend_analysis', 'general_audit'],
        'keywords': ['audit', 'checklist', 'procedures', 'compliance', 'inspection']
    },
    'quality_systems': {
        'primary_intents': ['quality_analysis', 'health_assessment', 'trend_analysis'],
        'secondary_intents': ['delta_analysis', 'audit_report', 'supplier_audit'],
        'keywords': ['quality', 'deviations', 'capas', 'non-conformances', 'quality events']
    },
    # ... additional agents
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Document Citation System

#### Improved Source Processing
- **Document ID Assignment**: Each document receives a unique ID (DOC_001, DOC_002, etc.)
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Extended metadata includes:
  - File name and extension
  - Page numbers and sections
  - Relevance scores
  - Company and date information
  - Source type classification

#### Citation Instructions
- **AI Model Guidance**: Automatic generation of citation instructions for the AI model
- **In-Line Citations**: Support for [DOC_XXX] format citations in responses
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed tracking of all document sources

#### Document Summary Compilation
```python
document_summary = {
    "total_documents": len(document_citations),
    "document_types": {".pdf": 5, ".csv": 3, ".docx": 2},
    "agents_used": ["quality_systems", "web_scraper", "sop"],
    "high_relevance_documents": [...],
    "document_breakdown": {...}
}
```
